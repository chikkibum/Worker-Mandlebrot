This guide provides instructions for setting up a local server to run a web application using Live Server, a lightweight extension available for various code editors.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Visual Studio Code (or any other code editor of your choice)
- Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

1. **Install Live Server Extension**: Open Visual Studio Code, navigate to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), and search for "Live Server". Install the extension provided by Ritwick Dey.

2. **Open Your Project**: Open your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Start Live Server**: Right-click on your HTML file in the editor and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Alt+L`, `Alt+O`.

4. **Access Your Web Application**: Live Server will automatically open your default web browser and navigate to your web application, running on a local server.

## Additional Notes
